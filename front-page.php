			<p><strong>This video is so good! </strong>Web design is a pretty new topic/area I'm trying to get a handle on. I was really intimidated when I started (honestly been intimidated for years). Your videos have been so helpful! I know this video is a few years old now but I hope you aren't still selling yourself short as a teacher. You're excellent. Thanks!</p>
